The issue appears to be in the frontend logic that filters providers by selected service. Admin panel shows provider 'John Smith' is associated with service 'Haircut', but booking wizard doesn't progress to provider selection step after service is clicked. Check provider filtering logic in BookingPage.js around line 86-88 (availableProviders filter) and ensure service-provider associations are working correctly.",
